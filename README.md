# iOS Usage of MMVM


MVVM stands for "Model-View-ViewModel." It's a software architecture commonly used in user interface development processes. Essentially, it separates an application's code into three primary components:

Model: Represents the data, business logic, and data processing rules of the application. The Model provides the fundamental data structure and functionality of the application.

View: Represents the user interface. The View is the part of the application where the user interacts and visually perceives the state of the application.

ViewModel: Acts as a liaison between the Model and the View. The ViewModel receives data provided by the Model and converts it into the format necessary to present it to the View. It also captures user interactions from the View and applies them to the Model.
